"""Phase 1.5 P1.5.1 — snapshot-invariant for the shared POST helper.

httpx merges the cookie jar into the outgoing ``httpx.Request`` synchronously
in ``build_request()``, before any ``await``. ``_perform_authed_post`` reads
the auth snapshot (via ``self._snapshot()``) and assembles ``(url, body,
headers)`` via ``build_request(snapshot)`` synchronously before
``await client.post(...)``. Therefore, within a single retry iteration the
entire ``(csrf, session_id, cookies)`` snapshot is atomic from a concurrent
coroutine standpoint: no other task can mutate state between read and the
wire.

T2.C moved the POST out of ``_rpc_call_impl`` into ``_perform_authed_post``
so chat (T2.D) can share the same transport pipeline. The AST guard below
follows the POST; the invariant still belongs at the shared site.

This file *locks* that invariant in two ways:

1. ``test_perform_authed_post_has_no_await_before_post_per_iteration`` —
   static AST guard against an ``await`` inside the retry loop of
   ``_perform_authed_post`` that precedes the iteration's ``client.post(...)``
   call.

2. ``test_concurrent_refresh_does_not_corrupt_inflight_rpc_request`` —
   runtime self-consistency. Drives concurrent ``refresh_auth`` against an
   in-flight ``rpc_call`` (both orderings) and asserts the captured
   ``httpx.Request`` is never observed with mixed-generation (csrf,
   session_id, cookies) state.

    ``await`` may sit lexically before the ``client.post(...)`` call.

    Each retry iteration starts with a synchronous ``self._snapshot()`` and
    a synchronous ``build_request(snapshot)`` — both are reads / assembly,
    no awaits. The very next statement is the actual POST. If anyone
    introduces an ``await`` between the snapshot read and the POST, a
    concurrent ``refresh_auth`` could mutate ``auth.csrf_token`` /
    ``auth.session_id`` / the cookie jar between the read and the wire,
    producing a mismatched-generation request.

    The check is per-iteration: awaits *between* iterations (e.g.
    ``await self._await_refresh()`` followed by ``continue``) are fine
